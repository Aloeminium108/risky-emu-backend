#### **nodemon** - 
> This application is using nodemon to monitor the devlopment of our express based Node.js app.
#### **bcrypt** -
> This application is using bcrypt to support proper password hashing and ensure user security.
#### **pg** -
> This application is using pg to be able to facilitate a connection to our local, soon to be cloud based, PGAdmin database.
